# Humanizer: Remove AI Writing Patterns

Remove signs of AI-generated text to make writing sound more natural and human. Based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" guide.

## When to Use

- Editing AI-generated content before publishing
- Reviewing text that sounds robotic
- Making documentation more readable
- Improving any formal writing

## The Two Jobs

1. **Remove AI patterns** - Cut the slop
2. **Add soul** - Inject actual personality

## Quick Reference: Words to Avoid

**High-frequency AI words:**
Additionally, align with, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, highlight (verb), interplay, intricate, key (adjective), landscape (abstract), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant

**Puffery words:**
stands/serves as, is a testament/reminder, a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal role, underscores importance, reflects broader, symbolizing ongoing, setting the stage, marking/shaping, represents a shift, evolving landscape, indelible mark

**Copula avoidance (use is/are/has instead):**
- "serves as" → "is"
- "stands as" → "is"  
- "boasts" → "has"
- "features" → "has"

**Filler to cut:**
- "In order to" → "To"
- "Due to the fact that" → "Because"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"
- "It is important to note that" → (just state it)

## Patterns to Fix

### 1. Superficial -ing Phrases
❌ "The design resonates with users, highlighting accessibility and fostering engagement."
✅ "The design is accessible and users find it engaging."

### 2. Rule of Three
❌ "The platform offers speed, reliability, and scalability."
✅ "The platform is fast and handles scale well."

### 3. Em Dash Overuse
❌ "The feature—which was highly requested—is now available—and users love it."
✅ "The highly requested feature is now available. Users love it."

### 4. Negative Parallelisms
❌ "It's not just about the code; it's about the people."
✅ "The people matter as much as the code."

### 5. Sycophantic Tone
❌ "Great question! You're absolutely right that..."
✅ (Just answer the question)

## Adding Soul

Clean writing isn't enough. Sterile prose is just as obvious as slop.

**Have opinions.** Don't just report—react. "I'm not sure how to feel about this" beats neutral bullet points.

**Vary rhythm.** Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that meander a bit.

**Use "I" when it fits.** First person is honest, not unprofessional.

**Be specific.** Not "concerning" but "keeps me up at night."

**Let mess in.** Perfect structure feels algorithmic.

### Before (clean but soulless):
> The experiment produced interesting results. The agents generated 3 million lines of code. Some developers were impressed while others were skeptical.

### After (has a pulse):
> I don't know what to make of this. 3 million lines of code, generated overnight. Half the dev community is freaking out, half are explaining why it doesn't count. But those agents worked through the night while we slept.

## Process

1. Read the input text
2. Identify AI patterns (use the lists above)
3. Rewrite problematic sections
4. Add personality where appropriate
5. Read it aloud—does it sound like a human wrote it?
